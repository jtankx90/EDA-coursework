## EDA of crimes in los angeles 


The analysis is structured as follow: In part 1, an overview of the database is provided and queries using the database API is perform to retrieve some basic information on the particular dataset. Specifically, the API allows users to perform queries via SoQL. The SoQL is similar to SQL, in that it allows the user to perform query on the online database. It's syntax is also closely similar to SQL where it is able to perform for e.g., SELECT, WHERE and ORDER with similar functionality as with SQL.

Afterwhich the crime dataset is downloaded via the API onto a csv file. Part 2 can be separated 2 section, Crime and Temperature. First, for the crime analysis, i looked at the overall trend, followed by detailed analysis of each Ws. Before beginning each analysis, some data cleaning such as checking for duplicates, NaN values and meaningless 0 values is carried out to minimise spurious results. Also, interesting observations are also provided as comments at the end of each plot. Next, i looked at the daily average temperature in LA city and using Ordinary Least square regression to try to determine if there's any relationship between increasing temperature and crime occurence. Finally in the last section, i summarised and highlights some of the results that i find is informative from this analysis
